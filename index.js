    professionalSummary: `As a dedicated polyglot programmer, I thrive in diverse technological environments, employing a robust toolkit of languages such as JS/TS, C#, Python, and Ruby. I bring extensive experience and continuously strive to hone my skills and deepen my knowledge each day. I enjoy embracing challenges, constructing innovative solutions, and learning new technologies.

Always on the lookout for new challenges, I aim to leverage my skills and curiosity to make a positive impact on the world.
